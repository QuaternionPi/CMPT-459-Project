## Data
We've selected climatology [data from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jsphyg/weather-dataset-rattle-package) titled "Rain in Australia". It has 23 columns including a mix of numeric and categorical data. It has over 140,000 entries and a total size of 140MB. 

The data includes a rich set of features to analyze. Numeric features include humidity, temperature and wind speed. Categorical features include location and wind direction. Most columns are numeric, which may affect our choice of classifiers.

Cleaning needs to be done on the data. This is expected to be a straight forward task, primarily replacing N/A values with medians and mode.
